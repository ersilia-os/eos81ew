    "Title": "Parallel Artificial Membrane Permeability Assay (PAMPA) 5",
    "Description": "Cell membrane permeability is important for determining oral absorption and bioavailability of drug molecule. Parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) is a low-cost alternative to cellular models for early ADME screening.",
    "Mode": "Pretrained",
    "Task": ["Classification"],
    "Input": ["Compound"],
    "Input Shape": "Single",
    "Output": ["Probability"],
    "Output Type": ["Float"],
    "Output Shape": "Single",
    "Interpretation": "It is a classification model which returns the probability of a compound having poor permeability (>=0.5: low permeability), and the probability of a compound being highly permeable (<0.5: moderate or high permeability)",
